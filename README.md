Creating a Caesar Cipher Encryption and Decryption Python Program

One of the oldest methods was born back in Ancient Rome called Caesar Cipher, which is simple and easy to perform method by shifting each letter a fixed number down through alphabet. We going to do this by creating a simple python program that enables users to encrypt and decrypt text using the algorithm. Step-by-Step Guide

1. Functions: caesar cipher implementations, ins and outs.

- Encryption Function:

- Decryption Function:

2. Handle User Input

- User Input Function

3. Association Main Function: Code to Tie it all Together

4. Run the Program:

Only dont forget the call to `main()`; ])

Explanation:

- Encryption Function:

â€“ Transform all characters of the text to their equivalent shifted case of character.

- Case insensitive (both upper and lower case)

Non-alphabet characters are written in as they come out of the function calls.

- Decryption Function:

- Employ the encryption function with negative right shift to get the original message back.

- User Input:

Receives the message and shift value from User

- Deals with the few available user operations for encrypting / decrypting

This is an easy to understand Python Program for Caesar Cipher which will encrypt and decrypt any message you choose! You can easily browse further commits and add features, like input validation or support for other character sets.
